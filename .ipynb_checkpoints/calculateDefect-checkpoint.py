    """
    Detect defects from a `.npy` file or an image file, calculate defect percentages, and show details.

    Parameters:
    - npy_path: Path to the `.npy` file (default is None).
    - image_path: Path to the image file (default is None).
    - threshold: Threshold value for binarization (default is 200).
    - min_area: Minimum area to consider a region as a defect (default is 100 pixels).
    - size: Tuple specifying the target size (width, height) to resize the input (default is (520, 520)).

    Returns:
    - defect_percentage: Percentage of the wafer that is defected.
    - largest_bbox_location: Location of the bounding box with the largest area (e.g., "top", "bottom", etc.).
