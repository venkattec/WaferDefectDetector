    """
    Detect and localize defects from a `.npy` file or an image file, resized to a standard size.

    Parameters:
    - npy_path: Path to the `.npy` file (default is None).
    - image_path: Path to the image file (default is None).
    - threshold: Threshold value for binarization (default is 200).
    - min_area: Minimum area to consider a region as a defect (default is 100 pixels).
    - size: Tuple specifying the target size (width, height) to resize the input (default is (520, 520)).

    Returns:
    - largest_defect_location: A string indicating the location of the largest defect.
